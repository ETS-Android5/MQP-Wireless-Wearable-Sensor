AS AN EXAMPLE OF SAFETY (LPS):
The Lightweight Protection System (LPS) or “cocoon” installed on Suffolk’s 60-story Millennium Tower project in Boston. The LPS envelops
large exterior sections of the building to ensure that workers, tools and equipment do not fall over the side during construction. The LPS
is slotted into a rail system that allows its panels to rise with the increasing height of the building as floors are added during construction.
The mesh design also allows natural light to illuminate work areas while protecting workers from the elements.
