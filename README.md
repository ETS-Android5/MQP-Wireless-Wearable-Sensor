Our project designed a wearable device that uses photoplethysmogram (PPG) waveforms to measure and estimate various vital signs via custom-designed algorithms running on a mobile application. These vital signs include peripheral oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiratory rate and short/long term heart rate variability. The device wirelessly transmits accumulated data to a mobile phone and/or a personal computer over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). A mobile application was developed that can receive, process, and display the extracted vital sign information. This project explores an emerging technology of wearable biomedical devices with the addition of the Internet of Things (IoT) element. Possible applications are varied; however, this wireless monitoring system would allow health providers to more eï¬€ectively monitor outpatient vital signs. In the wake of the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, the measurement of peripheral oxygen saturation would give an early warning of degrading respiratory health before the apparent manifestation of symptoms. The convenient use of the device in a mobile setting is especially relevant to current isolation precautions in place, in addition to its critical role in the improvement of the care of at-risk patients
